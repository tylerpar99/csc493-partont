# Test Plan

<p> My test plan for this application is largley based on unit test with pytest. This is a great unit testing framework for python back web applications. I will try to isolate current logic within the applicaton into specific functions to make it more efficient to test and ensure good coverage. </p>
  
  ## Identified Test Cases:
   <li>(Issue #2)Ensure a non logged in user can't access the internal application as this can cause a lot of problems</li>
   <li>(Issue #3)Block users from accessing private clubs that they are not memebers of.</li>
