`def logINFun(username, password):
  User = User.select(User.Pass).where(User.username == username)
  if password == User
    return "Log In Success"
  else:
    return "Username or password are incorrect."`
    
`def displayData(username):
  clubs = Clubs.select().Where(Clubs.user == username)
  interest = Interest.select().where(interest.user == username)`

`def joinClub(username, clubId):
  joinClub = Clubs.create(ClubId= clubId, club.username ==username)`
  
<p> More function will be needed based on solutions to how I will display a video, how I will monitor chats of underage user, how I will allow text based chats after they are filtered for invalid words. I will also need to figure out function for creating a club.</p>
