# HobbyHub
##Description/Motivation:
###During Covid many people were isolated without the ability to see ones they loved, or participate in the simple activites they loved previously. In the area I lived in there used to be car meets every weekend, book clubs, fantasy football clubs, bible studies, etc. My website aims to ensure this never happens again. My website is a place that can host clubs, hobby groups, etc. The emphasis on my website is ease of use and security. Parent can allow their child to create a book club online for kids and not have to worry about the use of inappropriate language or sketchy conversations happening without their knowledge. Adults of any age can come together with their car club and not have to worry about confusing navigation or millinial focused structure. Even the more official clubs can charge a club fee for sign ups, and host their merch on their club page for their memebers to easily access and order. My website will also be free, I want kids to be able to host and join clubs from accross the country and accross the world without worries about affording the fee. Even with the pandamic fading I still think their is a market of people who want to find groups of friends from around the world, or have mobility issues and can't make it their car meets, or parents who want their kids to have friends but feel safer with the monitoring my site offers.
