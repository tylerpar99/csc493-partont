## Description/Motivation:
### During the pandemic many people were isolated without the ability to see ones they loved, or participate in the simple activities they loved previously. In the area I lived in there used to be car meets every weekend, book clubs, fantasy football clubs, bible studies, etc. My website aims to ensure this never happens again. My website is a place that can host clubs, hobby groups, etc. The emphasis on my website is ease of use and security. Parent can allow their child to create a book club online for kids and not have to worry about the use of inappropriate language or sketchy conversations happening without their knowledge. Adults of any age can come together with their car club and not have to worry about confusing navigation or millennial focused structure. Even the more official clubs can charge a club fee for sign ups, and host their merch on their club page for their members to easily access and order. My website will also be free, I want kids to be able to host and join clubs from across the country and across the world without worries about affording the fee. Even with the pandemic fading I still think their is a market of people who want to find groups of friends from around the world, or have mobility issues and can't make it their car meets, or parents who want their kids to have friends but feel safer with the monitoring my site offers.

## Concept:
## Scope:
- Log in page

- the ability to filter by topic
- The ability to chat in a forum as well as host video meetings
- The ability to charge a fee for your club
- The ability to monitor a chat for a club for kids

## Vision:
  I want to create an application where everyone can come and hang out with their peers and meet regarding commone interets. I hope that people can get to know one another no matter where they are at in their country or where they are at in the world. If you love motorcycles why not meet someone who loves them too. If you have accessebility issues or just plain don't like traveling to engage in your hobby then hop on my webiste and meet new friends. Group creators and create merch for there club or charge fees to afford supplies. Everyone at any age can meet and hang out safely and securely on my website.
